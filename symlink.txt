Symlinks let you develop addons in your Git folder and have them instantly appear in the WoW AddOns directory without copying files.

This allows a single source to edit.



# Create Symlink (Directory)

1. Run Command Prompt as Administrator:
2. mklink /D "<INSERT LINKED FILE PATH>" "<INSERT SOURCE FILE PATH>"

[Example]
mklink /D "C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\PvPQTimer" "C:\Git\WeakAuraToAddon\PvPQTimer"



# Delete Symlink (Directory)
(Does NOT delete your real source code.)

1. Run Command Prompt as Administrator:
2. rmdir "<INSERT LINKED FILE PATH>" "<INSERT SOURCE FILE PATH>"

[Example]
rmdir "C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\PVPQTimes"




------------------------------
-- Important Notes --
------------------------------

> The source folder must exist, or the link becomes “dead.”
> Renaming/moving the source folder breaks the symlink (delete + recreate).
> Always run CMD as Administrator when linking into Program Files.
> /D means directory symlink — required for folders containing files.
> Symlinks look like normal folders, but they act as pointers.
