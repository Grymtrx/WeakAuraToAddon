PVPQTimer – Credits & Acknowledgements
--------------------------------------

This addon was created by Greymatter (Grymtrx).

PVPQTimer is an original work. All code, logic, formatting, and UI elements 
were written specifically for this addon. No source code was copied from any 
other addon.

However, several existing community projects inspired certain *ideas* or 
general approaches. In accordance with addon licensing rules, only concepts 
were referenced — never code.
