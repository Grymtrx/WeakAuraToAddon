# Elite Set Collection Tracker

A lightweight addon that recreates Mori's **Elite Set Collection Tracker** WeakAura inside the default PvP UI. It shows which classes have collected the current Elite appearance, dims uncollected classes, and marks classes you have not logged onto yet this season as “unknown”.

## Features
- Mirrors the Conquest panel layout and updates automatically on relevant transmog events or when the PvP UI is opened.
- Persists data per season, automatically resetting when Blizzard adds a new Elite set.
- Colored tooltips (class colors plus state-specific messages) and clear icon states (collected, missing, unknown).

If you enjoy this addon, please consider thanking Mori on the original Wago page—the addon would not exist without that work.
