PVPQTimer – Credits & Acknowledgements
--------------------------------------

This addon was created by Greymatter/Grymtrx.

It was inspired by and partially based on the following works:

- "PvP Queue" WeakAura by Vonnycakes
  * Source: https://wago.io/Wk9Jik5R4/2
  * Reused concepts:
    - Use of GetBattlefieldEstimatedWaitTime / GetBattlefieldTimeWaited
    - UPDATE_BATTLEFIELD_STATUS-based triggering

- "MMRTracker" by RGBDEV
  * Source: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mmr-tracker
  * Reused concepts:
    - Using C_PvP.GetScoreInfoByPlayerGuid to track prematch/postmatch MMR
    - Bracket ID mapping and region handling ideas

All code in this addon has been rewritten and adapted to fit the needs of PVPQTimer,
but the above projects were used as references for logic and structure.
